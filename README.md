# FreeAIOCR

**FreeAIOCR** (https://freeaiocr.com) is a **completely free-to-use** online AI-powered OCR tool designed specifically for developers, researchers, students, and technical users. Powered by advanced large language models and vision AI, it goes beyond simple text recognition to deeply understand and convert image content — including code structure, mathematical logic, tables, and diagrams — into clean, editable, and immediately usable digital formats.

## Core Features

1. **Image to Plain Text**  
   Extracts all visible text from images (supports printed text and reasonable handwritten notes).

2. **Extract & Format Programming Code from Images**  
   Recognizes over 50 programming languages with automatic language detection.  
   Understands indentation, syntax structure, and code logic.  
   Outputs beautifully formatted, ready-to-paste code for IDEs/editors.

3. **Math Formulas / Equations → LaTeX**  
   Accurately identifies complex mathematical expressions (matrices, integrals, summations, Greek letters, special symbols, etc.).  
   Outputs standard LaTeX code suitable for papers, notes, blogs, and Overleaf.

4. **Charts / Flowcharts / Diagrams → Mermaid Syntax**  
   Converts hand-drawn or screenshot diagrams (flowcharts, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, architecture diagrams, etc.) into valid Mermaid markup that renders instantly.

5. **Math Expressions → Executable Program Code**  
   Translates mathematical formulas directly into runnable code implementations in languages like Python, JavaScript, MATLAB, and more.

6. **Table Images → Markdown Tables**  
   Detects table structure from images and generates clean, well-formatted Markdown tables.

7. **Table Images → HTML Tables**  
   Produces ready-to-use HTML `<table>` code for web pages or documents.

## Key Advantages

- **Superior AI Understanding** — Far more intelligent than traditional OCR; correctly distinguishes variables (x) from multiplication symbols (×), code indentation from regular spaces, and preserves mathematical/logical structure.
- **Built-in Image Enhancement** — Automatically applies rotation correction, perspective fix, noise reduction, brightness/contrast adjustment for better accuracy.
- **Strong Privacy Protection** — Images are processed in real-time with encryption and permanently deleted immediately after conversion; nothing is stored, used for training, or shared with third parties.
- **Zero Installation · Browser-Based** — Works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, Linux, iPad, and mobile phones.
- **Convenient Upload Methods** — Drag & drop, click to select, or paste images with Ctrl+V / ⌘V.
- **Supported Formats** — Input: PNG, JPG, JPEG, WebP (up to 10MB per file).

## Supported Interface Languages

English, Japanese, Arabic, Spanish, Simplified Chinese, Russian, German, French.

## One-Sentence Summary  
**FreeAIOCR is currently the most developer- and researcher-friendly free online AI OCR tool — it doesn't just recognize characters; it truly understands code, formulas, and diagrams, delivering directly usable, production-ready digital content.**
